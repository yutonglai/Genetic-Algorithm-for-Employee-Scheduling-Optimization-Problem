A2. Objective

Develop AI algorithm to Help Wumart store managers determine the optimized labor schedule that can satisfy different applicable assumptions while lowering the labor cost.

A3. Assumptions & Limitations

Assumptions:

        1. Each assignee has the ability to handle different tasks;

        2. The amount of each task can be quantified;

        3. Each assigneeâ€™s productivity rate are different;

        4. Each assignee receives different wages;

        5. Each assignee will have at least one day off in a week;

        6. There will be more tasks at the weekend; (06/25/2019)

        7. The task types can be scheduled in advance. (07/16/2019)

Limitations:

        1. Minimize the overall labor cost;

        2. Care about the assignee preference and availability of time;

        3. Ensure enough employee for different tasks in different days;(06/19/2019)

        4. Ensure that the daily number of assignee in the store is as equal as possible; (06/19/2019)

        4. For a typical week, more assignee need to be allocate for the weekend;(06/26/2019)

        5. Ensure that the important/most effective assignee will not have the same day off;(06/19/2019)

        6. Consider task amount in promotion days.(06/21/2019)
        
        
#### Input data:
```
Date = '2019-07-22T'
#### load in working time code
ScheduleCode = pd.read_csv('/home/yutong/Dropbox/Retech Labs/StorX/data/schedule code list & decoded time 20180409 V2.csv')

#### Task time period
TaskTimeFrameDict = {'T1':'08:20-11:45',
                     'T2':'10:15-12:55',
                     'T3':'12:30-14:00',
                     'T4':'17:10-20:30'}

ScheduleCodeDict = ScheduleCode.set_index('Code')['time'].to_dict()
TaskList = list(TaskTimeFrameDict.keys())

#### The first column is time code, the last column is salary
column       =           ['Code'] +     TaskList    + ['Wage']
AssigneeDict = {'FA0001':['10K',   2,    3,    4,    5,   191],
                'FA0002':['10H',   3,    4,    2,    4,   155],

                'PA0005':['7AU',   6,    4,    3,    2,    56],
                'PA0006':['7BS',   2,    2,    2,    3,    45]}
```
#### Compute the true productivity according to the working time code and task time period
```
from productivity import Productivity

ProTrue, AssigneeDF, AssigneeList, Wage = Productivity(Date, ScheduleCodeDict, column, AssigneeDict)
```
#### Compute a schedule for a week, assuming weekend's workload is twice more than usual
```
from MakeSchedule import OneWeekSchedule

FullSchedule, DayoffSchedule, TotalCost, TaskCompletion = OneWeekSchedule(ProTrue, AssigneeDF, AssigneeDict, AssigneeList, TaskList, Wage)
```
#### We will get the optimized schedule, day-off schedule, Total cost and how the tasks are completed
