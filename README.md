# Genetic-Algorithm-for-Employee-Scheduling-Optimization-Problem
An implementation of genetic algorithm on scheduling optimization problem

#### A0. Summary

The modeling is part of the StorX AI project. It focuses on store labor scheduling optimization and related tasks.

#### A1. Developer info

Name: Yutong Lai

Location: San Diego, United State.

Email: 

#### A2. Objective

Develop AI algorithm to Help Wumart store managers determine the optimized labor schedule that can satisfy different applicable assumptions while lowering the labor cost.

#### A3. Assumptions & Limitations

Assumptions:

        1. Each assignee has the ability to handle different tasks;

        2. The amount of each task can be quantified;

        3. Each assigneeâ€™s productivity rate are different;

        4. Each assignee receives different wages;

        5. Each assignee will have at least one day off in a week;

        6. There will be more tasks at the weekend; (06/25/2019)

        7. The task types can be scheduled in advance. (07/16/2019)

Limitations:

        1. Minimize the overall labor cost;

        2. Care about the assignee preference and availability of time;

        3. Ensure enough employee for different tasks in different days;(06/19/2019)

        4. Ensure that the daily number of assignee in the store is as equal as possible; (06/19/2019)

        4. For a typical week, more assignee need to be allocate for the weekend;(06/26/2019)

        5. Ensure that the important/most effective assignee will not have the same day off;(06/19/2019)

        6. Consider task amount in promotion days.(06/21/2019)

#### Task time period

#### Compute the true productivity according to the working time code and task time period
```
from productivity import Productivity

ProTrue, AssigneeDF, AssigneeList, Wage = Productivity(Date, ScheduleCodeDict, column, AssigneeDict)
```
#### Compute a schedule for a week, assuming weekend's workload is twice more than usual
```
from MakeSchedule import OneWeekSchedule

FullSchedule, DayoffSchedule, TotalCost, TaskCompletion = OneWeekSchedule(ProTrue, AssigneeDF, AssigneeDict, AssigneeList, TaskList, Wage)
```
#### We will get the optimized schedule, day-off schedule, Total cost and how the tasks are completed
